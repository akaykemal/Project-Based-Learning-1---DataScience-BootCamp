This is a  Regression & Classification project

A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO PROFILING ONLINE DATERS ACCORDING TO AGE & GENERATION
1 - Can your dating profile predict your age?
2 - Can your dating profile predict the generation you belong to? (Millennial, Gen X-er, or Boomers)
Using a dataset of almost 60,000 anonymized entries from the dating platform OKCupid, You will explore 
the above questions using supervised machine learning techniques. You will examine different aspects or 
features of user profiles and see which ones you will integrate into your models to achieve the most
 satisfactory scores. You will use regression techniques to tackle the first question and classification
 models to address the second.
By exploring the “last_online” feature’s min and max, the OKCupid dataset could be inferred 
to be dated around 2011 or 2012. At the time, a “Millennial” would be aged from 18 to 32, a “Gen X-er” 33 to 47,
 and “Boomers” from 48 to 70 years
